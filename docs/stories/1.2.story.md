# Story 1.2: Portfolio List Page with react-bits Animations

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** visitor to the web agency portfolio site,
**I want** to browse completed projects in an animated portfolio gallery,
**so that** I can see the agency's work displayed in an engaging, interactive format that showcases their creative capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Portfolio list page (`/portfolio`) displays completed projects in card-based UI layout
2. Each project card includes subtle react-bits animation effects on mouse hover
3. Cards display project title, brief description, tech stack, and hero image
4. Smooth scroll-triggered animations reveal cards as user scrolls down
5. Responsive design works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints
6. Card animations are optimized using lazy loading with Next.js dynamic imports
7. Filtering functionality allows users to filter projects by technology or category
8. All animations perform smoothly without causing layout shifts (CLS < 0.1)
9. Accessibility is maintained with proper ARIA labels and reduced motion support

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- Project uses `front/src/` directory structure (not root level)
- Existing animation components available: TypewriterText, FadeInText, AnimatedButton, ParticleSystem
- Performance optimization patterns established with dynamic imports and mobile-responsive settings
- Comprehensive test suite patterns established with React Testing Library
- `@/` alias configured to point to `front/src/` directory
- Jest configuration fixed for proper module resolution

### Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (React Framework) [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **UI Library:** react-bits for animations and interactive components [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with utility-first approach [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **TypeScript:** For type safety and better developer experience
- **Development Guidelines:** Use `smithery-ai-github mcp` to reference react-bits implementations [Source: architecture/3-development-guidelines.md]

### File Locations
Based on actual project structure from Story 1.1:
- Portfolio page: `/front/src/pages/portfolio.tsx` [Source: architecture/4-project-structure.md]
- Portfolio card component: `/front/src/components/react-bits/PortfolioCard.tsx`
- Type definitions: `/front/src/types/portfolio.ts`
- Portfolio data: `/front/src/data/portfolio.json` [Source: architecture/4-project-structure.md]
- Test files: `/front/src/__tests__/pages/portfolio.test.tsx`

### Performance Requirements
- **Lazy Loading:** Use `next/dynamic` for heavy animation components [Source: architecture/6-performance-optimization-considerations.md]
- **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js `Image` component for portfolio images [Source: architecture/6-performance-optimization-considerations.md]
- **Core Web Vitals Targets:** 
  - LCP < 2.5s
  - FID < 100ms
  - CLS < 0.1
  [Source: docs/epics/epic-react-bits-integration.md]

### Component Reuse Opportunities
From Story 1.1 established components:
- **AnimatedButton**: Reuse for filter controls with existing hover effects
- **FadeInText**: Reuse for card entrance animations with staggered delays
- **Loading**: Reuse for dynamic import loading states
- **TypeScript patterns**: Follow existing interface patterns from `/front/src/types/hero.ts`

### Integration Points
From epic requirements [Source: docs/epics/epic-react-bits-integration.md]:
- `/front/src/components/react-bits/` - Follow existing component patterns
- `/front/src/pages/` - Use established Next.js page structure with dynamic imports
- `/front/src/styles/` - Ensure Tailwind utilities work correctly with react-bits
- Maintain existing SSG capabilities and SEO optimization
- Follow existing responsive design patterns

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain SSG capabilities - ensure components work with static generation
- Preserve existing Next.js patterns and file structure from Story 1.1
- Follow Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Ensure backward compatibility - no breaking changes to existing components
- Use established `@/` import alias pattern

### Project Structure Notes
- **CRITICAL**: Files must be created in `front/src/` directory structure (established in Story 1.1)
- **Import Pattern**: Continue using `@/` alias pointing to `front/src/` directory
- **Configuration**: TypeScript, Tailwind, and Jest configurations already updated for src structure
- **Existing Structure**: Follows `front/src/pages/`, `front/src/components/`, `front/src/types/` pattern

### Testing Standards
Based on Story 1.1 patterns:
- **Test Location:** `/front/src/__tests__/pages/portfolio.test.tsx` and `/front/src/__tests__/components/`
- **Testing Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library (already configured)
- **Test Patterns:** Follow existing test structure from AnimatedButton and page tests
- **Accessibility Testing:** Include ARIA assertions for screen reader support
- **Animation Testing:** Mock heavy animations in tests to improve performance
- **Jest Configuration:** Already fixed (`moduleNameMapper` properly configured)
