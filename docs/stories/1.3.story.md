## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 and 1.2 implementation:
- Project uses `front/src/` directory structure (not root level)
- Existing animation components available: TypewriterText, FadeInText, AnimatedButton, ParticleSystem
- Performance optimization patterns established with dynamic imports and mobile-responsive settings
- Comprehensive test suite patterns established with React Testing Library
- `@/` alias configured to point to `front/src/` directory
- Jest configuration fixed for proper module resolution

### Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (React Framework) [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **UI Library:** react-bits for animations and interactive components [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with utility-first approach [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **TypeScript:** For type safety and better developer experience
- **Development Guidelines:** Use `smithery-ai-github mcp` to reference react-bits implementations [Source: architecture/3-development-guidelines.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure from [Source: architecture/4-project-structure.md]:
- Contact page: `/front/src/pages/contact.tsx`
- Form components: `/front/src/components/react-bits/ContactForm.tsx`, `/front/src/components/react-bits/AnimatedInput.tsx`
- Type definitions: `/front/src/types/contact.ts`
- Test files: `/front/src/__tests__/pages/contact.test.tsx`

### Performance Requirements
- **Lazy Loading:** Use `next/dynamic` for heavy animation components [Source: architecture/6-performance-optimization-considerations.md]
- **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js `Image` component for any form-related images [Source: architecture/6-performance-optimization-considerations.md]
- **Core Web Vitals Targets:** 
  - LCP < 2.5s
  - FID < 100ms
  - CLS < 0.1
  [Source: docs/epics/epic-react-bits-integration.md]

### Component Reuse Opportunities
From Story 1.1 and 1.2 established components:
- **AnimatedButton**: Reuse for submit button with existing hover effects
- **FadeInText**: Reuse for section headings and form labels
- **Loading**: Reuse for dynamic import loading states
- **TypeScript patterns**: Follow existing interface patterns from `/front/src/types/portfolio.ts`

### Integration Points
From epic requirements [Source: docs/epics/epic-react-bits-integration.md]:
- `/front/src/components/react-bits/` - Follow existing component patterns
- `/front/src/pages/` - Use established Next.js page structure with dynamic imports
- `/front/src/styles/` - Ensure Tailwind utilities work correctly with react-bits
- Maintain existing SSG capabilities and SEO optimization
- Follow existing responsive design patterns

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain SSG capabilities - ensure components work with static generation
- Preserve existing Next.js patterns and file structure from Stories 1.1 and 1.2
- Follow Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Ensure backward compatibility - no breaking changes to existing components
- Use established `@/` import alias pattern

### Project Structure Notes
- **CRITICAL**: Files must be created in `front/src/` directory structure (established in Stories 1.1 and 1.2)
- **Import Pattern**: Continue using `@/` alias pointing to `front/src/` directory
- **Configuration**: TypeScript, Tailwind, and Jest configurations already updated for src structure
- **Existing Structure**: Follows `front/src/pages/`, `front/src/components/`, `front/src/types/` pattern

### Testing Standards
Based on Story 1.1 and 1.2 patterns:
- **Test Location:** `/front/src/__tests__/pages/contact.test.tsx` and `/front/src/__tests__/components/`
- **Testing Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library (already configured)
- **Test Patterns:** Follow existing test structure from AnimatedButton and page tests
- **Accessibility Testing:** Include ARIA assertions for screen reader support
- **Animation Testing:** Mock heavy animations in tests to improve performance
- **Jest Configuration:** Already fixed (`moduleNameMapper` properly configured)
