# Story 1.3: Contact Section with Form Animations

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** potential client visiting the web agency portfolio site,
**I want** to contact the agency through an engaging animated form,
**so that** I can inquire about services with a professional and interactive experience that builds confidence in their technical capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Contact form includes animated input fields using react-bits components
2. Form validation provides animated feedback for success/error states
3. Submit button includes loading animation during form processing
4. Form includes micro-interactions for enhanced user experience
5. Contact section integrates smoothly with existing site navigation
6. Form is fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints
7. Accessibility is maintained with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
8. Form animations respect user's reduced motion preferences
9. Form submission provides clear success/error feedback with animations

- [ ] Task 6: Optimize with Next.js dynamic imports (AC: 6, 8)
  - [ ] Convert heavy animation components to dynamic imports
  - [ ] Add loading states for lazy-loaded form components
  - [ ] Test performance impact and optimize where needed
  - [ ] Verify Core Web Vitals remain within targets

- [ ] Task 7: Ensure accessibility and reduced motion support (AC: 7, 8)

  - [ ] Test form validation logic and error handling
  - [ ] Test form submission flow and loading states
  - [ ] Test accessibility features and keyboard navigation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 and 1.2 implementation:
- Project uses `front/src/` directory structure (not root level)
- Existing animation components available: TypewriterText, FadeInText, AnimatedButton, ParticleSystem
- Performance optimization patterns established with dynamic imports and mobile-responsive settings
- Comprehensive test suite patterns established with React Testing Library
- `@/` alias configured to point to `front/src/` directory
- Jest configuration fixed for proper module resolution

### Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (React Framework) [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **UI Library:** react-bits for animations and interactive components [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with utility-first approach [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **TypeScript:** For type safety and better developer experience
- **Development Guidelines:** Use `smithery-ai-github mcp` to reference react-bits implementations [Source: architecture/3-development-guidelines.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure from [Source: architecture/4-project-structure.md]:
- Contact page: `/front/src/pages/contact.tsx`
- Form components: `/front/src/components/react-bits/ContactForm.tsx`, `/front/src/components/react-bits/AnimatedInput.tsx`
- Type definitions: `/front/src/types/contact.ts`
- Test files: `/front/src/__tests__/pages/contact.test.tsx`

### Performance Requirements
- **Lazy Loading:** Use `next/dynamic` for heavy animation components [Source: architecture/6-performance-optimization-considerations.md]
- **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js `Image` component for any form-related images [Source: architecture/6-performance-optimization-considerations.md]
- **Core Web Vitals Targets:** 
  - LCP < 2.5s
  - FID < 100ms
  - CLS < 0.1
  [Source: docs/epics/epic-react-bits-integration.md]

### Component Reuse Opportunities
From Story 1.1 and 1.2 established components:
- **AnimatedButton**: Reuse for submit button with existing hover effects
- **FadeInText**: Reuse for section headings and form labels
- **Loading**: Reuse for dynamic import loading states
- **TypeScript patterns**: Follow existing interface patterns from `/front/src/types/portfolio.ts`

### Integration Points
From epic requirements [Source: docs/epics/epic-react-bits-integration.md]:
- `/front/src/components/react-bits/` - Follow existing component patterns
- `/front/src/pages/` - Use established Next.js page structure with dynamic imports
- `/front/src/styles/` - Ensure Tailwind utilities work correctly with react-bits
- Maintain existing SSG capabilities and SEO optimization
- Follow existing responsive design patterns

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain SSG capabilities - ensure components work with static generation
- Preserve existing Next.js patterns and file structure from Stories 1.1 and 1.2
- Follow Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Ensure backward compatibility - no breaking changes to existing components
- Use established `@/` import alias pattern

### Project Structure Notes
- **CRITICAL**: Files must be created in `front/src/` directory structure (established in Stories 1.1 and 1.2)
- **Import Pattern**: Continue using `@/` alias pointing to `front/src/` directory
- **Configuration**: TypeScript, Tailwind, and Jest configurations already updated for src structure
- **Existing Structure**: Follows `front/src/pages/`, `front/src/components/`, `front/src/types/` pattern

### Testing Standards
Based on Story 1.1 and 1.2 patterns:
- **Test Location:** `/front/src/__tests__/pages/contact.test.tsx` and `/front/src/__tests__/components/`
- **Testing Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library (already configured)
- **Test Patterns:** Follow existing test structure from AnimatedButton and page tests
- **Accessibility Testing:** Include ARIA assertions for screen reader support
- **Animation Testing:** Mock heavy animations in tests to improve performance
- **Jest Configuration:** Already fixed (`moduleNameMapper` properly configured)
