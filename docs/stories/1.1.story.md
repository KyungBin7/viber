# Story 1.1: Hero Section with react-bits Animations

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** visitor to the web agency portfolio site,
**I want** to see an engaging animated hero section when I land on the homepage,
**so that** I'm immediately impressed by the agency's creative capabilities and technical expertise

## Acceptance Criteria

5. All animations perform smoothly without causing layout shifts (CLS < 0.1)
6. Hero section is fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints
7. Animations are optimized using lazy loading with Next.js dynamic imports
8. Accessibility is maintained with proper ARIA labels and reduced motion support

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story in the project.

### Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (React Framework) [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **UI Library:** react-bits for animations and interactive components [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with utility-first approach [Source: architecture/2-core-technology-stack.md]
- **TypeScript:** For type safety and better developer experience

### Component Specifications
- **Location:** Create new component at `components/react-bits/HeroSection.tsx` [Source: architecture/4-project-structure.md]
- **Integration:** Component will be imported and used in `pages/index.tsx` [Source: architecture/4-project-structure.md]
- **react-bits Reference:** Use `smithery-ai-github mcp` to reference react-bits component implementations [Source: architecture/3-development-guidelines.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/4-project-structure.md]:
- Hero component: `/components/react-bits/HeroSection.tsx`
- Main page integration: `/pages/index.tsx`
- Type definitions: `/types/` directory for any new interfaces
- Global styles: `/styles/` directory for any custom Tailwind configurations

### Performance Requirements
- **Lazy Loading:** Use `next/dynamic` for heavy animation components [Source: architecture/6-performance-optimization-considerations.md]
- **Image Optimization:** If hero includes images, use Next.js `Image` component [Source: architecture/6-performance-optimization-considerations.md]
- **Core Web Vitals Targets:** 
  - LCP < 2.5s
  - FID < 100ms
  - CLS < 0.1
  [Source: docs/epics/epic-react-bits-integration.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain SSG capabilities - ensure components work with static generation
- Preserve existing Next.js patterns and file structure
- Follow Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Ensure backward compatibility - no breaking changes to existing components

### Integration Points
From the epic [Source: docs/epics/epic-react-bits-integration.md]:
- `/components/ui/` - May need to coordinate with existing UI components
- `/pages/index.tsx` - Main integration point for the hero section
- `/styles/` - Ensure Tailwind utilities work correctly with react-bits

### Testing Standards
No specific testing strategy document found in architecture docs. Recommend:
- Create test files alongside components (e.g., `HeroSection.test.tsx`)
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Test accessibility with appropriate ARIA assertions
- Mock heavy animations in tests to improve test performance

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with sophisticated animation systems, comprehensive TypeScript interfaces, and thoughtful performance optimizations. The components follow React best practices with proper state management, effect cleanup, and accessibility considerations. The modular architecture makes the codebase maintainable and extensible.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: front/jest.config.js
  - **Change**: Fixed `moduleNameMapping` to `moduleNameMapper` 
  - **Why**: Jest configuration was invalid causing warnings during test runs
  - **How**: Corrected the configuration property name to match Jest's expected API

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript interfaces, proper component structure, accessibility support
- Project Structure: ✓ Components organized in react-bits directory, proper src structure
