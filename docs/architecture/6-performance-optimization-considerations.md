# 6. Performance Optimization & Considerations
While `react-bits` animations are visually stunning, they can impact performance, so the following strategies will be considered:
* **Lazy Loading:** Components with heavy animations will be loaded only when they come into the viewport to improve initial loading speed. We will use Next.js's dynamic import (`next/dynamic`).
* **Image Optimization:** We will use Next.js's `Image` component for portfolio images to automatically apply optimizations (resizing, WebP conversion, etc.).

This architecture effectively leverages the strengths of `react-bits` while adhering to modern web development standards and considering both performance and maintainability.
