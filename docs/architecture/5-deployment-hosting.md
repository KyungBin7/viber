# 5. Deployment & Hosting
* **Deployment Platform:** **Vercel** or **Netlify**
    * **Reasoning:** These platforms integrate perfectly with Next.js and allow for easy setup of a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) environment that automatically builds and deploys on every Git commit (e.g., to GitHub). They are optimized for static site hosting, making them cost-effective.
* **Build Process:**
    1.  Developer pushes code to Git.
    2.  Vercel/Netlify detects the code and starts the build.
    3.  Next.js generates all pages as static HTML, CSS, and JS files, including `react-bits` components.
    4.  The generated files are deployed to a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
